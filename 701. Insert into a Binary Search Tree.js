701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree

You are given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to insert into the tree. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

Notice that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.

Example 1:
    Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
    Output: [4,2,7,1,3,5]
    Explanation: Another accepted tree is:

Example 2:
    Input: root = [40,20,60,10,30,50,70], val = 25
    Output: [40,20,60,10,30,50,70,null,null,25]

Example 3:
    Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,null], val = 5
    Output: [4,2,7,1,3,5]

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [0, 104].
    -108 <= Node.val <= 108
    All the values Node.val are unique.
    -108 <= val <= 108
    It's guaranteed that val does not exist in the original BST.

EXPLORE

Want to insert new node in a BST

BRAINSTORM

Could use either iterative or recursion to insert the new node

Both O(log N) time complexity
Recursion is O(log N) space while iterative is O(1)

Approach 1: Iterative while loop
Time Complexity: O(log N) if binary tree is balanced else O(N) if BST is a linked list
Space Complexity: O(1) need to store current node pointer in memeory

Approach 1: Recursive
Time Complexity: O(log N) if binary tree is balanced else O(N) if BST is a linked list
Space Complexity: O(log N) for the recursive call stack
